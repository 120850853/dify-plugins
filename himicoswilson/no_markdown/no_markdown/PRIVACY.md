# No Markdown Plugin Privacy Policy

## Data Collection and Usage

The No Markdown plugin does not collect, store, or process any personal data. The plugin only processes the text content provided by users for the purpose of removing markdown syntax, and this processing is performed in real-time without any data retention.

### Types of Data Processed

The plugin processes only:
- Text content provided by the user during the markdown removal operation
- URL links within the text (if the user chooses to preserve them)

No personal identification information is collected or processed, including but not limited to:
- Names
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Addresses
- Device information
- IP addresses
- Location data
- User credentials
- Usage statistics

### Data Processing

1. **Purpose of Processing**:
   - The only purpose of data processing is to remove markdown syntax from the provided text
   - If enabled, preserve URL links in a readable format
   - No data is used for any other purposes

2. **Data Storage**:
   - The plugin does not store any data
   - All text processing is performed in memory and is immediately discarded after the operation is complete
   - No logs or history of processed content is maintained

3. **Third-Party Services**:
   - The plugin does not share any data with third-party services
   - All processing is performed locally within the plugin
   - No external APIs or services are used

## Data Security

Since no data is stored or transmitted to external services, there are no security risks associated with data retention or transmission. The plugin operates entirely within the Dify platform's security boundaries.
